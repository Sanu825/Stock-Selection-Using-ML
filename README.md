# Stock Selection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on historical stock price data and then used to forecast future prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, keras, matplotlib, pandas_datareader

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Selection-Using-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stock-Selection-Using-ML
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your historical stock price data in CSV format and place it in the designated directory: `Processing_Historical_Data/Dow_Jones`.
2. Update the `file_name` variable in the `stock_prediction.py` file to specify the name of the CSV file containing the data you want to analyze.
3. Run the `stock_prediction.py` script:
   ```bash
   python stock_prediction.py
   ```
4. The script will train the LSTM model on the provided data and generate predictions for future stock prices.
5. Visualizations of the historical data, model training process, and predicted prices will be displayed.

## Files

- `stock_prediction.py`: Python script for training the LSTM model and generating stock price predictions.
- `Processing_Historical_Data/Dow_Jones/`: Directory for storing historical stock price data in CSV format.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
